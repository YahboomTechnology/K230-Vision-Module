# Introduction
Yahboom K230 vision module is a high-performance, low-power embedded AI vision processing module designed for edge computing scenarios. It is designed based on the end-side AloT chip of the RISC-V architecture, with 6TOPS equivalent computing power and 1GB RAM. It can be connected to a variety of main controllers such as STM32, MSPM0, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, etc. through serial communication. Equipped with a powerful neural network acceleration engine, it supports AI vision tasks such as real-time image recognition, target detection, face recognition, and behavior analysis. It can be widely used in smart homes, maker education, programming robots, electronic design competitions and other occasions.

* On board 2MP camera(GC2093), 2.4-inch touch screen, microphone, RGB light, WiFi network card and other hardware resources, support TF card (32G TF card will be provided for free).

*  Adopting Kendryte K230 chip, 1GB RAN, equivalent computing power can reach 6TOPS.
  
*  Pre-installed GUI program, integrated with 30+ functions (human posture recognition, object recognition, image detection, road sign recognition, label code recognition light), users can quickly experience.
  
*  Provide version host computer software on Windows, support RTSP real-time video stream monitoring, and integrate video/image processing tools, data generator, text tools and other content.
  
*  Three different height brackets and 2DOF electric PTZ are available, users can fix the module on some robots or smart cars.
